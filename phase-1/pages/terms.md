# Rules

The competition rules, meant to ensure fair and accurate evaluation of submissions, are specified below:

- Submissions must be free and reproducible, and the winning solutions must be made public after the competition ends. You may use paid tools to develop your submissions, however after your solution is made public, reproducing its results on the benchmarking tasks must be free for users. **We require that methods are made open-source by the end of each phase in order to be eligible for prizes.**
- Participants must not extract any information about the ground truth labels for the test task datasets through any means or attempt any prohibited behavior listed in the following section that may be considered as cheating.
- Submissions may reuse open-source code only with proper attribution.
- Participants are free (and in fact encouraged) to use additional resources or data from related tasks beyond those provided by the organizers.

We strictly prohibit any form of cheating, including:

- Two teams having similar or identical solutions
- Attempting to access test datasets
- Any other actions we deem to be inappropriate
- Copying existing code or repositories without proper attribution. **Note that between phases, participants may bootstrap solutions from previous phases (with, of course, proper attribution).** 


More generally:

- **Registration:** The participants must register to CodaBench and provide a valid email address. Teams must register only once and provide a group email, which is forwarded to all team members. Teams or solo participants registering multiple times to gain an advantage in the competition may be disqualified.
- **Anonymity:** The participants who do not present their results at the workshop can elect to remain anonymous by using a pseudonym. Their results will be published on the leaderboard under that pseudonym, and their real name will remain confidential. However, the participants must disclose their real identity to the organizers to claim any prize they might win. 
- **Submission method:** The results must be submitted through this CodaBench site. The number of submissions per day and maximum total computational time are restrained and subject to change, according to the number of participants. 
- **Reproducibility:** The participant should make efforts to guarantee the reproducibility of their method, which in particular implies that they should use everywhere in their code the same random seed, as exemplified in the starting kit. **And once again, solutions must be made publicly available at the end of each phase in order to be eligible for prizes.**
